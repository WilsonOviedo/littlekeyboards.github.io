## The Build

### Install Diodes

More detailed information about soldering diodes can be found [here](../soldering-guides/smd-soldering). Be sure to add all 60 diodes.

### Install Pro Micro

Installing the Pro Micro at this time will allow for a quick test of the PCB to make sure all switch footprints respond appropriately. More detailed information about testing PCBs can be found [here](../soldering-guides/testing-pcbs).

### Install Hotswap Sockets

### Install RGB LEDs

More detailed information about soldering RGB LEDs can be found [here](../soldering-guides/rgb-leds).

### Install Switches

Now is a good time to remove the small stabilizer bar that comes installed on linear and tactile choc switches. This is optional, but it removes the rattling sound when typing or just moving the keyboard.

### Install Keycaps

### Install the Rubber Feet

### Celebrate

It wasn't easy, but it sure was worth it. Take a picture.
